# Welcome to My GitHub Pages Website
## Hello there, thank you for stopping by!
My name is **Huyen**, and in this simple static website, I will write a bit about myself as well as one of my hobbies, which is gardening, using the ***Markdown language syntax*** on GitHub Pages.

### About me
I have changed my career from the healthcare field to IT. It has been interesting but also challenging at the same time for me. I've had the opportunity to learn new programming languages, work on exciting projects, and collaborate with talented professionals in the tech industry. The transition has opened up a world of possibilities, and I'm excited to continue growing my skills and contributing to the ever-evolving field of information technology.

The dynamic nature of the IT field keeps me engaged and motivated. While there have been moments of uncertainty, each challenge I've encountered has been an opportunity for growth. I look forward to embracing future challenges, expanding my knowledge, and making meaningful contributions to the digital world.

### My hobbies
- Gardening
* Practicing yoga
+ Watching comedy movies/shows

_ _I love spending my free time on gardening work, tending to my plants, and enjoying other activities like watching comedies and practicing yoga_ _.

Gardening work has become a source of profound satisfaction for me. The act of nurturing plants and witnessing their growth brings a sense of fulfillment and a deeper connection to nature :gardening: . Whether it's tending to vibrant flower beds, cultivating a thriving vegetable garden, or simply enjoying the serenity of outdoor gardening, I find solace and joy in every moment spent amidst the beauty of nature.

Watching comedies allows me to unwind and enjoy a good laugh, providing a great way to relax and temporarily escape from the demands of daily life :smile: . I have a list of favorite comedians and classic comedy shows that I never tire of.

Yoga, on the other hand, is my go-to activity for maintaining physical and mental well-being :man_in_lotus_position: . It helps me stay centered and reduces stress through a combination of stretching, deep breathing, and mindfulness during yoga sessions, leaving me feeling refreshed and energized.

Balancing my IT career with these hobbies brings a sense of harmony to my life, and I find that they complement each other well, providing me with the perfect blend of relaxation and rejuvenation :heart:

> - Alfred Austin

> "A weed is a plant that has mastered every survival skill except for learning how to grow in rows."
